OBJECTIVE:

Implement a git like client system with limited capabilities. The program should be able
  • to create/initialize a git repository, creating a .git folder with the necessary details.
  • to add files to index and commit, maintaining the commit-ids so that retrieving them
    back could be done.
  • to see the status, diff, checkout previous commits, as shown by the git utility.
  
Commands to be Implemented
1. init
2. add
3. status
4. commit
5. rollback
6. checkout
7. diff
8. log
9. push
10. pull
